I'm thinking for each lyric we'll have 2 picture options, which are kept in the `assets/images` folder.  Hoping that GitHub allows enough storage to put more eventually! (Github provides a ***soft*** limit of **1GB** for the repo, so we'll see how much that gives us)

Here are some potential lyrics with options:

    I have a pet [dog] [cat]
    It says [meow] [ribbit]
    And when I play the [piano] [toothbrush]
    We make [music] [dinner] together
