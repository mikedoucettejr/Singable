## Welcome to Singable !! :)

In this game, you will write your own song by filling in the blanks for a series of pre-written lyrics.


Here's how it works:
* Choose a word to fill in the blank of the lyric. The word options are represented by pictures. To hear the lyric read aloud, press the up arrow.
* The `Next` button at the bottom of the page will move on to the next lyric.
* Once you've filled in all four lyrics, you can hear a song that is generated from your lyrics. You'll also get a Singable Score based on your choices. You'll probably get a high score, which means that you did a great job!
* Press the `Play Again` button to start over.  Each unique combination of choices will create a new song!


These keys will read something aloud. Press them whenever you need to hear something on the screen:
* `Up arrow` reads current lyric, and reads the score on the last page!
* `Left arrow` tells you the left picture option.
* `Right arrow` tells you the right picture option.
