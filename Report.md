## Singable

### Description of the Project
Singable is a songwriting game where the player chooses words to fill in the blanks of a series of lyrics.  After filling in the blanks of all the lyrics, they can hear their song played back to them!  The song is actually a series of MIDI notes that are generated based on the number of syllables in each word of the lyric.  A voice that reads the lyrics is layered on top of this song and the beats are aligned to create a track that sounds like music should, with notes and voice in sync.  

A huge "Singable Score" is included at the end to provide encouragement to the player.  It doesn't really have any meaning, but hopefully it will make them feel like they've done a great job.The player can then choose to play again, and this will create a new game where the options for each lyric are randomly selected, meaning that there are many unique songs that the player can create. 

### Intended Audience
We tried to design a game that includes children with various disabilities. Our game is made for anyone who wants to ‘sing’ along to music that normally cannot, primarly children with vocal impairments. It's also build for childen with visual impairments because it's compliant with accessibility devices (according to the WAVE evaluator), and every lyric and picture option can be read aloud by clicking buttons.  Lastly, the game is designed to include children with cognitive impairments because the gameplay will be as simple as possible, and pictures will be used as additional cues.

Beyond this intended audience, the game could be fun for adults with any of these impairments, or children without impairments, given the playful nature of the lyrics.

### The Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries used
For the front end, we used JS and JQuery, as well as the web speech API called SpeechSynthesisUtterance to read the elements of the webpage aloud.  

### How to Access the Game

### Problems Encountered
We took a lot of risks in developing our project, especially with the back end. (Ross, hit it)

### Future Work
Given that this project only reached the basics of our MVP, there is plenty of room for future work.  The UI could definitely use playful animations and additional features.  Ideally, a full version of the game would have a feature that allow users to enter their own lyrics and create their own songs to express their creativity.
